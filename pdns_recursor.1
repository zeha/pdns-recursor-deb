.SH NAME
pdns_recursor \- high-performance, simple and secure recursing nameserver
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


\fIpdns_recursor\fR [\-\-daemon] [\-\-local\-address] [\-\-help, \-h] [\-\-allow\-from]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


pdns_recursor(1) is a high performance, simple and secure recursing nameserver\&. It currently powers over two million internet connections\&.


The recursor is configured via a configuration file, but each item in that file can be overridden on the command line\&.


This manpage lists the core set of features needed to get the PowerDNS recursor working, for full and up to date details head to http://doc\&.powerdns\&.com/built\-in\-recursor\&.html

.SH "EXAMPLES"


To listen on 1\&.2\&.3\&.4 and allow the 1\&.2\&.3\&.0/8 subnet to recurse, and run as a daemon, execute:

.nf
# pdns_recursor \-\-local\-address=1\&.2\&.3\&.4 \-\-allow\-from=1\&.2\&.3\&.0/8 \-\-daemon
.fi


To stop the recursor by hand, run:

.nf
# rec_control quit
.fi

.nf
Alternatively, use the init\&.d script provided\&.
.fi

.SH "OPTIONS"


For authoritative listing of options, consult the documentation referenced above\&.

.TP
\-\-aaaa\-additional\-processing
turn on to do AAAA additional processing (slow)

.TP
\-\-allow\-from
If set, only allow these comma separated netmasks to recurse

.TP
\-\-auth\-can\-lower\-ttl
Authoritative zones can transmit a TTL value that is lower than that specified in the parent zone\&. This is called a \fIdelegation inconsistency\fR\&. To follow RFC 2181 paragraphs 5\&.2 and 5\&.4 to the letter, enable this feature\&. This will mean a slight deterioration of performance, and it will not solve any problems, but does make the recursor more standards compliant\&. Not recommended unless you have to tick an \fIRFC 2181 compliant\fR box\&. Off by default\&.

.TP
\-\-auth\-zones
Comma separated list of \fIzonename=filename\fR pairs\&. Zones read from these files are served authoritatively\&. Example: auth\-zones= ds9a\&.nl=/var/zones/ds9a\&.nl, powerdns\&.com=/var/zones/powerdns\&.com\&. Available since 3\&.1\&.

.TP
\-\-chroot
switch to chroot jail

.TP
\-\-client\-tcp\-timeout
Timeout in seconds when talking to TCP clients

.TP
\-\-config\-dir
Location of configuration directory (recursor\&.conf)

.TP
\-\-daemon
Operate as a daemon

.TP
\-\-delegation\-only
Which domains we only accept delegations from

.TP
\-\-export\-etc\-hosts
If set, this flag will export the host names and IP addresses mentioned in /etc/hosts\&. Available since 3\&.1\&.

.TP
\-\-fork
If set, fork the daemon for possible double performance

.TP
\-\-forward\-zones
Comma separated list of \fIzonename=IP\fR pairs\&. Queries for zones listed here will be forwarded to the IP address listed\&. auth\-zones= ds9a\&.nl=213\&.244\&.168\&.210, powerdns\&.com=127\&.0\&.0\&.1\&. Available since 3\&.1\&.

.TP
\-\-hint\-file
If set, load root hints from this file

.TP
\-\-local\-address
IP addresses to listen on, separated by spaces or commas

.TP
\-\-local\-port
port to listen on

.TP
\-\-log\-common\-errors
If we should log rather common errors

.TP
\-\-max\-cache\-entries
If set, maximum number of entries in the main cache

.TP
\-\-max\-negative\-ttl
maximum number of seconds to keep a negative cached entry in memory

.TP
\-\-max\-tcp\-clients
Maximum number of simultaneous TCP clients

.TP
\-\-max\-tcp\-per\-client
If set, maximum number of TCP sessions per client (IP address)

.TP
\-\-query\-local\-address
Source IP address for sending queries

.TP
\-\-query\-local\-address6
Send out local IPv6 queries from this address\&. Disabled by default, which also disables outgoing IPv6 support\&. A useful setting is \fI::0\fR\&.

.TP
\-\-quiet
Suppress logging of questions and answers

.TP
\-\-remotes\-ringbuffer\-entries
maximum number of packets to store statistics for

.TP
\-\-server\-id
Returned when queried for \fIserver\&.id\fR TXT, defaults to hostname

.TP
\-\-serve\-rfc1918
On by default, this makes the server authoritatively aware of: 10\&.in\-addr\&.arpa, 168\&.192\&.in\-addr\&.arpa and 16\-31\&.172\&.in\-addr\&.arpa, which saves load on the AS112 servers\&. Individual parts of these zones can still be loaded or forwarded\&.

.TP
\-\-setgid
If set, change group id to this gid for more security

.TP
\-\-setuid
If set, change user id to this uid for more security

.TP
\-\-single\-socket
If set, only use a single socket for outgoing queries

.TP
\-\-socket\-dir
Where the controlsocket will live

.TP
\-\-spoof\-nearmiss\-max
If non\-zero, assume spoofing after this many near misses

.TP
\-\-trace
if we should output heaps of logging

.TP
\-\-version\-string
string reported on version\&.pdns or version\&.bind
