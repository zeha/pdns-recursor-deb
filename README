DOCUMENTATION

For full details, please read:

COMPILING
---------

$ ./configure
$ make or gmake

The only dependency is Boost, http://boost.org/
You only need to download it, there is no need to compile.

On most modern UNIX distributions, you can simply install 'boost' or
'boost-dev' or 'boost-devel'. If you don't have that option, or don't want
to use it, try:

1) head to http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586 and
download the latest boost tar.bz2 or tar.gz, perhaps from:
http://surfnet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/boost/boost_1_33_1.tar.bz2
(use the first link if this one doesn't work)

2) untar it:

$ tar xjf boost_1_33_1.tar.bz2

3) Compile the PowerDNS recursor using:

$ CXXFLAGS=-I./boost_1_33_1/ ./configure
$ CXXFLAGS=-I./boost_1_33_1/ make clean 
$ CXXFLAGS=-I./boost_1_33_1/ make all
(the 'clean' is needed to have make pick up the new boost)

4) Run ./pdns_recursor and you should be set!

5) (g)make install

PLATFORM SPECIFIC NOTES
-----------------------
When compiling on Solaris 8, use:
$ CPPFLAGS=-DSOLARIS8 ... gmake 

where ... stands for any possible CXXFLAGS or PROFILEFLAGS, see below.

PERFORMANCE
-----------

For the utmost in performance, compile like this:

   $ PROFILEFLAGS=-fprofile-generate make

Then run the program for a bit, in as much of a real-life setting as you
have available. Then run:

   $ rec_control quit
   bye 

Then do:

   $ PROFILEFLAGS=-fprofile-use make clean all

The resulting binary is up to 20% faster in our tests.

Do run with g++ 4.1 if you can, it is the best.

RUNNING ON A DIFFERENT MACHINE
------------------------------
To prevent hassles with g++ 4.1 dependencies, you can build like this:
   $ STATIC=semi make all

PROBLEMS
--------
If you have problems linking, try removing the GCC_SKIP_LOCKING line from
config.h
